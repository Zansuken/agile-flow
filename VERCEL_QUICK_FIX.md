# 🚀 Quick Vercel Deployment Fix

## The Issue
Vercel is still trying to run `cd frontend && npm install` which fails because it can't find the frontend directory from the build context.

## 🎯 Solution: Deploy Frontend Directory Directly

### Method 1: Deploy from Frontend Directory (Recommended)

1. **In Vercel Dashboard:**
   - Go to [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new)
   - Select your GitHub repository: `Zansuken/agile-flow`
   - **IMPORTANT**: Set Root Directory to `frontend`
   - Framework preset: Vite
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Output Directory: `dist`
   - Install Command: `npm install`

2. **Deploy**
   - Click "Deploy"
   - Vercel will now run commands from the frontend directory

### Method 2: Using Vercel CLI (Alternative)

```bash
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd /Users/rekhamuralidharan/Documents/code/agile-flow/frontend

# Deploy from frontend directory
npx vercel

# Follow prompts:
# Set up and deploy? Y
# Which scope? (your account)
# Link to existing project? N (or Y if you want to update existing)
# Project name? agile-flow-frontend
# Directory with code? ./ (current directory - frontend)
```

### Method 3: Force Project Settings Update

If you already have a Vercel project:

1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Settings → General
3. **Root Directory**: Change to `frontend`
4. **Build Command**: `npm run build`
5. **Output Directory**: `dist`
6. **Install Command**: `npm install`
7. Save and redeploy

## 🔧 Why This Works

By setting the Root Directory to `frontend`, Vercel will:
- ✅ Run all commands from the frontend directory
- ✅ Find the package.json correctly
- ✅ Install dependencies without path issues
- ✅ Build the React app successfully

## 📁 Current Project Structure
```
agile-flow/
├── frontend/          ← Vercel should start here
│   ├── package.json
│   ├── src/
│   ├── dist/
│   └── vercel.json    ← Now also here for good measure
├── backend/
├── shared/
└── vercel.json        ← Root level (might be ignored)
```

## ⚡ Quick Test

After deployment, your app should be available at:
- `https://your-project-name.vercel.app`

The React router should work correctly with the rewrite rules in place.

## 🆘 Still Having Issues?

1. **Delete the existing Vercel project** and create a new one
2. **Make sure Root Directory is set to `frontend`**
3. **Check the build logs** - they should show commands running from frontend/
4. **Verify environment variables** are set in Vercel dashboard

## ✅ Success Indicators

You'll know it's working when you see in the build logs:
```
Running "install" command: `npm install`...
✅ (instead of `cd frontend && npm install`)

Running "build" command: `npm run build`...
✅ (instead of `cd frontend && npm run build`)
```
