# 🚨 RAILWAY DEPLOYMENT CRASH FIX

## The Issue
Railway can't find the `start:prod` script, which means it's either:
1. Not running from the `backend` directory correctly
2. Not finding the right package.json file

## ✅ IMMEDIATE FIX: Update Railway Settings

### Step 1: Go to Railway Dashboard
1. **Project**: https://railway.com/project/a9d80ddc-5780-4d92-9727-6323cd292ace
2. **Click your service → Settings**

### Step 2: Update Start Command
**CRITICAL**: Change the start command to use direct node execution:

**OLD**: `npm run start:prod`  
**NEW**: `node dist/main.js`

### Step 3: Verify Other Settings
Make sure these are correct:
- **Root Directory**: `backend`
- **Build Command**: `npm run build`
- **Install Command**: `npm ci`

### Step 4: Alternative Commands to Try

If `node dist/main.js` doesn't work, try these in order:

1. `node dist/main` (without .js)
2. `npm start` (uses the basic start script)
3. `node dist/src/main.js` (if main.js is in a subfolder)

## 🔧 What I Fixed

✅ **Updated Procfile**: Changed to `web: node dist/main.js`  
✅ **Direct node execution**: Bypasses npm script issues

## 🎯 Expected Success

After changing the start command, you should see:
```
✅ Container starting...
✅ NestJS application starting...
✅ Server running on port $PORT
```

Instead of:
```
❌ npm error Missing script: "start:prod"
```

## 🚀 Deploy Steps

1. **Update start command in Railway dashboard**
2. **Save settings**
3. **Redeploy**
4. **Check logs for successful startup**

The key is using `node dist/main.js` instead of `npm run start:prod`! 🚀
