# 🚨 FORCE NIXPACKS DEPLOYMENT

## The Issue
Railway is still using the old cached Dockerfile despite our fixes.

## ✅ Solution: Force Nixpacks Build

### Step 1: Railway Dashboard Settings
1. **Go to your Railway project**: https://railway.com/project/a9d80ddc-5780-4d92-9727-6323cd292ace
2. **Click on your backend service**
3. **Go to Settings → Build**
4. **Set Builder to "Nixpacks"** (NOT Docker)
5. **Save settings**

### Step 2: Clear Build Cache
1. **In your service settings**
2. **Find "Danger Zone" or "Advanced"**
3. **Click "Clear Build Cache"**
4. **Confirm the action**

### Step 3: Redeploy
1. **Go to Deployments tab**
2. **Click "Deploy Now"** or **"Redeploy"**

## 🔧 What I Added
- ✅ `nixpacks.toml` - Forces Railway to use Nixpacks
- ✅ Updated `.railwayignore` - Better exclusions
- ✅ Explicit build configuration

## 📋 Expected Success
After forcing Nixpacks, you should see:
```
✅ Using Nixpacks
✅ Installing dependencies...
✅ Building application...
✅ Starting service...
```

Instead of:
```
❌ Using Detected Dockerfile
❌ CHOWN error
```

## 🎯 Alternative: Manual Builder Selection
If the nixpacks.toml doesn't work:
1. Railway Dashboard → Service → Settings
2. **Builder**: Select "Nixpacks" manually
3. **Root Directory**: `backend`
4. **Build Command**: `npm run build`
5. **Start Command**: `npm run start:prod`

This should bypass the Dockerfile entirely! 🚀
