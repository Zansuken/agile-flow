# 🚨 CRITICAL: Vercel Deployment Issue Resolution

## The Problem
Vercel keeps trying to run `cd frontend && npm install` even after configuration changes. This suggests cached project settings.

## 🎯 IMMEDIATE SOLUTION

### Step 1: Delete Existing Vercel Project
1. Go to [vercel.com/dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Find your `agile-flow` project
3. Settings → Advanced → **Delete Project**

### Step 2: Deploy Fresh with CLI from Frontend Directory

```bash
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd /Users/rekhamuralidharan/Documents/code/agile-flow/frontend

# Deploy directly from frontend
npx vercel

# When prompted:
# Set up and deploy? Y
# Which scope? (select your account)
# Link to existing project? N
# Project name? agile-flow-frontend
# Directory with code? ./ (current directory)
# Auto-detect settings? Y (should detect Vite)
```

### Step 3: Alternative - GitHub Integration Reset

If you prefer dashboard deployment:

1. **Disconnect GitHub integration** for the old project
2. **Create new project** from dashboard
3. **Import from GitHub** - select `agile-flow` repo
4. **CRITICAL**: Set Root Directory to `frontend` BEFORE first deployment
5. **Framework**: Vite
6. **Deploy**

## 🔍 Why This Happens

Vercel caches project configurations. Once it starts using `cd frontend && npm install`, it may persist this even after vercel.json changes.

## ✅ Expected Success Log

After the fix, you should see:
```
✅ Running "install" command: `npm install`...
✅ Running "build" command: `npm run build`...
✅ Build completed successfully
```

## 🚀 Current State

- ✅ Removed root vercel.json (eliminated conflicts)
- ✅ Frontend vercel.json configured correctly  
- ✅ .vercel/project.json created for frontend deployment
- ✅ Ready for fresh deployment

## 📋 Quick Checklist

Before redeploying:
- [ ] Delete existing Vercel project (if any)
- [ ] Deploy from frontend directory OR set Root Directory to `frontend`
- [ ] Verify build commands don't include `cd frontend`
- [ ] Add environment variables after successful build

## ⚡ Fastest Fix

**Use Vercel CLI from frontend directory:**
```bash
cd frontend
npx vercel --prod
```

This bypasses all configuration issues by deploying directly from the frontend folder.
