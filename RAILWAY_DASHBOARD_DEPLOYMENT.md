### Step 3: Add Environment Variables

**Critical**: Go to Variables tab and add these:

```bash
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=$PORT
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_firebase_project_id
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=your_service_account_email
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nyour_private_key_here\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
CORS_ORIGIN=https://your-frontend.vercel.app
```

### Step 4: Get Firebase Service Account

2. **Click "Deploy Now" or push to your main branch**
3. **Monitor the build logs** for any errors

### Step 6: Test Your Backend

Once deployed, your backend will be available at:
```
https://agile-flow-production.up.railway.app
```

Test the health endpoint:
```
https://your-backend-url.railway.app/api/health
```

### Step 7: Update Frontend

1. **Go to your Vercel project dashboard**
2. **Settings â†’ Environment Variables**
3. **Update `VITE_API_BASE_URL`** to your Railway URL
4. **Redeploy frontend** to connect to the backend

## ðŸ”§ Configuration Files Ready

âœ… `railway.yaml` - Updated for proper backend deployment  
âœ… `backend/package.json` - Has all required scripts

3. **Port**: Always use `$PORT` in Railway (they assign the port dynamically)

## âœ… Success Indicators

You'll know it's working when:
- âœ… Build completes without errors
- âœ… Service shows as "Active" 
- âœ… Health endpoint returns 200 OK
- âœ… Frontend can make API calls

## ðŸ†˜ Need Help?

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the build logs in Railway dashboard
