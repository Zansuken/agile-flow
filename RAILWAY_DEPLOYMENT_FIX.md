# ðŸš¨ Railway Deployment Fix

## The Issue
Railway was using the root Dockerfile instead of the backend-specific configuration.

## âœ… Fixes Applied

1. **Fixed root Dockerfile**: Changed `CHOWN` to `RUN chown`
2. **Added `.railwayignore`**: Excludes root Dockerfile from backend deployment
3. **Updated railway.yaml**: Added Nixpacks build commands

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

### Option 1: Redeploy from Railway Dashboard
1. Go to your Railway project: https://railway.com/project/a9d80ddc-5780-4d92-9727-6323cd292ace
2. Go to your service â†’ Deployments
3. Click "Redeploy" on the latest deployment
4. Or trigger a new deployment by pushing to GitHub

### Option 2: Force Railway to Use Nixpacks (Not Docker)
In your Railway service settings:
1. Go to Settings tab
2. Find "Build Configuration"
3. Set Builder to "Nixpacks" (not Docker)
4. This will use npm commands instead of Dockerfile

### Option 3: CLI Redeploy
```bash
cd /Users/rekhamuralidharan/Documents/code/agile-flow
npx @railway/cli up
```

## ðŸ”§ Environment Variables Reminder

Make sure these are set in Railway dashboard:
```
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=$PORT
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=agile-flow-f6b2c
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=firebase-adminsdk-fbsvc@agile-flow-f6b2c.iam.gserviceaccount.com
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n[your key here]\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
CORS_ORIGIN=https://your-frontend.vercel.app
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Expected Success

After the fix, you should see:
```
âœ… Build completed successfully
âœ… Service started on port $PORT
âœ… Health check passing
```

The Docker error should be resolved! ðŸš€
